**New Navigation Design:**
```typescript
// Header layout with integrated navigation
<header>
  <div className="flex items-center justify-between">
    <div className="flex items-center space-x-4">
      {/* Logo and title */}
    </div>
    <div className="flex items-center space-x-4">
      {/* Feature descriptions */}
      {/* Navigation toggle on far right */}
    </div>
  </div>
</header>
