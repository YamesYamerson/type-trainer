# Typing Trainer

A modern, keyboard-first typing practice application built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. Modeled after popular typing tutors like Monkeytype and Mavis Beacon, this app provides multiple practice modes with real-time feedback and performance tracking.

- **WPM (Words Per Minute)**: Standard calculation (5 characters = 1 word)
- **Accuracy**: Percentage of correctly typed characters
- **Error Tracking**: Real-time error highlighting and correction
- **Time Measurement**: Precise timing from first keystroke to completion

### ðŸ‘¤ User Management
- **Dummy Authentication**: Simple login system (any email/password works)
- **Profile Dashboard**: Comprehensive statistics and test history
- **Mode-specific Stats**: Performance breakdown by practice type
- **Persistent Storage**: Results saved locally using localStorage

### ðŸŽ¨ Modern UI/UX
- **Keyboard-first Design**: Complete functionality without mouse dependency
- **Responsive Layout**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
- **Clean Interface**: Minimalist design focused on typing practice
- **Real-time Feedback**: Color-coded character highlighting

## Tech Stack
