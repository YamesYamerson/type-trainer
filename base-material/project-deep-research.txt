Tailored Typing Practice App – Tech Stack & Development Plan

Monkeytype’s popularity is partly due to its flexibility, letting users practice typing “any way you want”
kbd.news
. Our goal is to build a similar typing tutor with customizable practice modes (standard text, punctuation, coding, data entry, etc.), using a cost-efficient tech stack suitable for a solo developer. Below we outline the recommended technology stack and a development plan with milestones.
Recommended Tech Stack

    Front-End: A web-based interface built with React and TypeScript. This combination enables a dynamic single-page app and strong type-checking for fewer bugs. In fact, Monkeytype’s open-source codebase is ~79% TypeScript
    github.com
    , showing the value of TypeScript for a project like this. React (or a similar framework like Svelte or Vue) will simplify building interactive UI components (text displays, input handling, live WPM calculations). A bundler/dev server such as Vite is ideal for fast development and performance
    github.com
    . The front-end will handle real-time typing logic entirely in the browser (for snappy feedback).

    Back-End: Use Node.js with an Express framework for a lightweight REST API
    github.com
    . This keeps development in one language (JavaScript/TypeScript) across front and back ends, which is efficient for a single developer. The server will manage user accounts, store test results, and serve custom content as needed. Monkeytype itself uses Express.js with a Node/TypeScript stack (plus caching via Redis) to power features like its account system and history tracking
    github.com
    github.com
    . If you prefer not to maintain a custom server, an alternative is a Backend-as-a-Service like Firebase. Firebase provides authentication, database, and hosting out-of-the-box, allowing you to focus on core features
    dev.to
    . Its free Spark Plan is very generous (unlimited basic auth and a decent amount of database/storage operations) – perfect for a no-budget solo project
    dev.to
    .

    Database & Storage: For a self-hosted backend, a NoSQL database like MongoDB is a good choice (Monkeytype uses MongoDB for storing user data)
    github.com
    . MongoDB Atlas has a free tier that can suffice for an MVP. A relational DB (MySQL/Postgres) would also work, but schemaless MongoDB pairs well with storing flexible test records and configurations. If using Firebase, you can use Cloud Firestore, which on the free tier allows plenty of reads/writes per day for early users
    dev.to
    . Both approaches will reliably store users’ performance data and any custom text datasets. User uploaded content (if any, e.g. custom text files) can be stored in Firebase Storage or a simple cloud storage bucket (most likely, however, all practice text can be predefined or small in size).

    Hosting & Deployment: The front-end can be deployed on free static hosting services (Netlify, GitHub Pages, Vercel, or Firebase Hosting which offers free SSL and CDN)
    dev.to
    . For a Node/Express backend, you could use a free tier on platforms like Render or Railway, or deploy on Vercel as serverless functions (especially if using Next.js). All recommended technologies are open-source or have free tiers, minimizing costs. Using a PWA (Progressive Web App) approach can also allow users to “install” the web app and use it offline for practice, reinforcing the keyboard-first experience without needing a native app.

Development Plan & Milestones

Below is a step-by-step development plan with milestones, ensuring the project is manageable and feature-complete over time:

    Project Setup & Initial Scaffold: Set up the development environment and repository. Initialize a React + TypeScript project (using Vite or Create React App) and configure basic project structure. If you plan to use a custom backend, scaffold a simple Express server (or set up a Firebase project if going serverless). Verify that you can run the front-end and (if applicable) the back-end locally. For example, create a basic page that prints keystrokes to ensure keyboard events are captured. This milestone establishes the foundation and ensures all chosen tech is properly configured.

    Core Typing Test (Basic Words): Implement the core typing test functionality with random lowercase words – similar to Monkeytype’s default test
    dev.to
    . Develop a words generator (you can use an open word list or Monkeytype’s word list under its GPL license) and display a sequence of words for the user to type. Capture the user’s keyboard input and provide real-time feedback: highlight correct vs. incorrect characters and calculate WPM and accuracy on the fly. After the time runs out or the test is completed, show results (WPM, accuracy, errors). Focus on accuracy of the WPM calculation and a smooth typing experience (no input lag). At this stage, data can be kept in memory or saved to local storage since user accounts aren’t live yet. Milestone outcome: a basic typing test working end-to-end for a single session.

    Extended Character Practice (Caps & Punctuation): Expand the typing tests to include capitalization, punctuation, and numbers on demand
    github.com
    . You might introduce a toggle or mode setting for “Include punctuation and numbers.” Implementing this could involve using a different text source – for example, a list of sentences/quotes that naturally contain commas, periods, capital letters, etc. (Monkeytype has a quotes mode for this purpose). Ensure the typing logic can handle these symbols (you may need to allow punctuation keys and case-sensitivity in input matching). The WPM formula might remain the same, but ensure that characters like punctuation don’t break the counting. Milestone outcome: users can opt to practice with full English text, not just lowercase words, which addresses more realistic typing scenarios (periods, capitals at sentence starts, etc.).

    Programming Code Typing Mode: Introduce a mode for coding practice. This mode will present code snippets (in languages like Python, JavaScript, etc.) for the user to type. The goal is to get users comfortable typing symbols like { } < > = ; and other syntax which are common in code but rare in prose. Consider sourcing some simple open-source code snippets or using an existing dataset of programming exercises. Display the code in a monospaced font and preserve indentation/newlines if applicable. It’s known that typical typing tutors ignore symbol keys and backspaces, leading to inflated WPM, whereas including these keys provides “realistic practice” for programmers
    typing.io
    . Decide how to handle tabs or multiple lines: you could require hitting “Enter” for new lines and maybe ignore actual tab characters (since moving focus could be an issue). This mode will teach users to type sequences like if(x[i] != y){...} accurately. Milestone outcome: a coding practice mode that loads a snippet and measures typing speed/accuracy on it, helping users practice the “awkward characters in code”
    typing.io
    .

    Data Entry & Custom Text Modes: Add a practice mode for data entry and/or allow custom text input by the user. For data entry, you can generate realistic data strings – e.g. simulating typing forms or database records: phone numbers, addresses, product codes, etc. This will focus on numbers, mixed alphanumeric strings, and symbols like @ or - (for email addresses, credit card numbers, etc.), refining the user’s ability to input structured data quickly. In parallel, a “custom text” mode lets users paste any text (or choose a file) and practice typing it. This feature greatly increases the app’s customizability, allowing users to practice exactly what they want – a key reason Monkeytype succeeded
    kbd.news
    . You’ll need to build an input UI to submit custom text and then integrate that into the test interface. Reuse the existing typing logic for this mode. Milestone outcome: enhanced practice options – including user-provided content and specialized data strings – making the app useful for a wider range of real-world typing tasks.

    User Accounts & Progress Tracking: Implement a basic account system so users can log in and have their typing statistics saved
    github.com
    . If you’re using a custom Node/Express backend, set up routes for user signup/login (consider using libraries for authentication, or OAuth if you plan social logins) and a database schema for storing user profiles and test results. If you’re using Firebase or a similar service, you can enable Firebase Authentication (which allows email/password and social logins for free)
    dev.to
    and use Cloud Firestore/Realtime DB to store each test result under the user’s account. Ensure that after each test, if a user is logged in, the result (WPM, accuracy, mode, timestamp, etc.) is sent to the backend or Firebase for storage. Create a simple profile dashboard where users can see their history of results – e.g., a table or graph of past WPM scores, their high scores, and accuracy over time. This persistent tracking will encourage users to practice more and see their improvement. Milestone outcome: multi-session support with user accounts – users can sign up, log in, and have their own stats/history (even if just dummy data at first to test the flow).

    UI/UX Enhancements and Theming: Now that core features are in place, improve the interface and usability. Design a clean, minimalistic layout (taking inspiration from Monkeytype’s focus mode UI) to keep users immersed while typing. Implement a theming system – for example, offer a few preset color themes (dark mode, light mode, high-contrast, etc.) and allow the user to choose one
    dev.to
    . The referenced Monkeytype clone project implemented multiple themes like default, mkbhd, coral, ocean, etc., showing that theme support can be added relatively easily
    dev.to
    . You should also add small quality-of-life features: a smooth caret (animated cursor) option, sounds on key press or completion, and responsive design (so it’s usable on different screen sizes, even if it’s “keyboard first” for desktop). Prioritize accessibility too – ensure focus indicators are visible, and consider adding an onscreen keyboard highlight for beginners. By the end of this phase, the app should not only function well but also look polished and offer a customizable experience for the user.

    Testing & Feedback (Beta Release): Rigorously test the application with different scenarios. Verify that all modes (plain words, punctuation, code, etc.) accurately measure speed and handle errors properly. Test edge cases like extremely fast typing, copy-paste attempts (ensure they’re prevented or handled), and long texts. It’s wise to invite a few people (friends or online volunteers) to try a beta version and provide feedback. They might discover usability issues or bugs you missed. Use their feedback to refine features – for instance, maybe the code mode needs a larger font, or the punctuation test should have an option to exclude rare symbols, etc. Also monitor performance: ensure the app remains smooth even when rendering long texts or on slightly older devices. Fix any bugs found and tune the scoring algorithms if needed (e.g., ensure backspacing is handled correctly in all modes). Milestone outcome: a stable, user-tested app ready for launch. All critical bugs should be resolved at this stage.

    Launch & Future Plans: Deploy the first version of your app. With free hosting (Firebase, Netlify, etc.), make sure your custom domain (if any) is set up and SSL is working. Announce the launch to communities who might be interested (e.g. r/MechanicalKeyboards, typing enthusiast forums) to start gaining users and feedback. Post-launch, plan future enhancements based on user demand. A major future milestone could be multiplayer racing (like TypeRacer-style competitions), but this is deliberately deferred – implementing real-time multiplayer is significantly complex and can be stressful for a solo developer
    kbd.news
    . (The Monkeytype developer noted that building a real-time online race mode was challenging and affected his mental health, so tackling it later once the single-player app is solid is wise
    kbd.news
    .) Other future improvements might include: adding more languages or locales (so users can practice typing in Spanish, French, etc.), creating structured lessons (like teaching home-row, similar to Mavis Beacon’s approach), and integrating analytics to show users detailed insights (e.g. which keys they miss often). Milestone outcome: the app is live for end-users, and you have a roadmap for future growth, addressing advanced features once you have the time or help to implement them.
