# Sprite Maker Development Notes

## Current Implementation Status

### ‚úÖ Completed Features
- Basic canvas drawing with pixel-perfect precision
- Multiple drawing tools: pencil, eraser, fill, eyedropper
- Layer system with visibility toggle and active layer selection
- Color management with primary/secondary colors and color pickers
- Customizable canvas sizes (16x16 to 256x256)
- Brush size adjustment (1-10 pixels)
- Color palette with predefined colors
- Export functionality (PNG format)
- Responsive UI with dark theme

### üîß Core Components
1. **App.tsx** - Main application state and layout
2. **SpriteEditor.tsx** - Canvas drawing engine with mouse handling
3. **Toolbar.tsx** - Drawing tools and canvas controls
4. **LayerPanel.tsx** - Layer management interface
5. **ColorPalette.tsx** - Quick color selection
6. **ExportPanel.tsx** - Save/export functionality

### üé® Drawing Tools Implementation
- **Pencil**: Basic pixel drawing with line interpolation
- **Eraser**: Sets pixels to transparent
- **Fill**: Flood fill algorithm for connected areas
- **Eyedropper**: Color sampling (basic implementation)
- **Rectangle/Circle/Line**: Placeholder tools for future development

### üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture
- React 18 + TypeScript
- Canvas API for pixel manipulation
- State management with React hooks
- Modular component structure
- CSS-in-JS for styling

## üöÄ Next Development Phase

### High Priority Features
1. **Complete Tool Implementation**
   - Rectangle tool with click-and-drag
   - Circle tool with radius calculation
   - Line tool with Bresenham's algorithm
   - Polygon tool for complex shapes

2. **Enhanced Drawing Features**
   - Brush patterns and textures
   - Symmetry tools (horizontal/vertical/radial)
   - Selection and transformation tools
   - Copy/paste functionality

3. **Advanced Layer Features**
   - Layer opacity controls
   - Layer blending modes
   - Layer grouping
   - Layer effects (shadows, outlines)

### Medium Priority Features
1. **Animation Support**
   - Frame-based animation
   - Timeline interface
   - Onion skinning
   - Frame duplication

2. **File Management**
   - Save/load project files (.sprite format)
   - Import existing images
   - Export to multiple formats (GIF, WebP, etc.)
   - Recent files list

3. **User Experience**
   - Undo/redo system
   - Keyboard shortcuts
   - Customizable interface
   - Zoom and pan controls

### Low Priority Features
1. **Advanced Tools**
   - Gradient fill
   - Pattern fill
   - Noise generation
   - Color replacement

2. **Collaboration**
   - Real-time collaboration
   - Version history
   - Comments and annotations

## üêõ Known Issues & Limitations

1. **Performance**: Large canvas sizes (128x128+) may have performance issues
2. **Memory**: No limit on layer count or canvas size
3. **Mobile**: Touch support not implemented
4. **Accessibility**: Limited keyboard navigation and screen reader support

## üîç Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests**: Component rendering and state management
2. **Integration Tests**: Tool interactions and canvas operations
3. **Performance Tests**: Large canvas and layer operations
4. **User Testing**: Drawing workflow and tool usability

## üì± Browser Compatibility

- Chrome/Edge: Full support
- Firefox: Full support
- Safari: Full support
- Mobile browsers: Limited support (touch events needed)

## üéØ Success Metrics

- Drawing responsiveness < 16ms per frame
- Support for 256x256 canvas with 10+ layers
- Export quality matching input resolution
- User satisfaction with tool usability
